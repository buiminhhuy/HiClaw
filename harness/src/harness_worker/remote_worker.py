"""Remote (local-environment) harness worker.

``RemoteWorker`` runs the harness agent in a developer's local environment
(laptop/workstation) instead of as a controller-managed Kubernetes pod. It is a
thin subclass of :class:`harness_worker.worker.Worker`: the entire bootstrap,
Matrix relay, and ``claude -p`` invocation flow is inherited unchanged — the
harness worker is not modified.

The only remote-specific behaviour added here is a **scoped push of agent-setup
files under ``.harness/``** so a developer does not lose their local setup when
switching the machine running the remote worker. The standard ``push_loop``
excludes the whole runtime-home dir (``.harness/``); cluster workers keep it
local, but remote workers persist a curated subset to MinIO so it follows the
developer across environments. Pull is already handled by ``FileSync.mirror_all``
at startup (it mirrors the full ``agents/<name>/`` prefix, including ``.harness/``).

Security boundary: ``.env`` (Matrix token, gateway key, MinIO creds) is never
pushed. A developer can opt individual files out of the push via
``.harness/.harnessignore`` (gitignore-style patterns).
